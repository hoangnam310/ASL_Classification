# ASL Classification

To run this repo, first of all you need to create a python 3.11 environment. I prefered using `conda create -n <your env name> python=3.11`
Then install the requirements library `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Since I already trained the model, you just need to run the cell in Section 4 which are testing the model.
